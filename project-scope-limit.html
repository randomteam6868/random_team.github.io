  <h3>Project's Limitation</h3>
  <p>Because of the limit of time, we do not upgrade all the functions we mention above and complete a project. Our scope is complete three functions, but we have developed two functions: providing the elders with information for their asking and making microblogging available for the elderly. These functions are the fundamental function which can be shown now. We have already trying to apply AI to our website, but it makes our website being crash. It shows that we still have a limit of knowledge in Ai technology to develop AI function. Also, to combine all the functions we mentioned, it makes our website work not incorporated.</p>

    <p class="text-left">First, our website would be made by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript since all of our team members have been learning them in Intro to IT at RMIT, which is more convenient to build a website. As a result, our team decided to choose Visual Studio Code as the essential software to code.</p>
    <p class="text-left">Second, every team member must use Git and GitHub to keep track of the progress of our project and communicate between members of the team. Third, one of the essential parts of a website is a database. To be more specific, a database is an IT term that refers to gather and store data. On our website, the database will gather and save both public data shared on the website and private data such as customers’ information. There is some software to build a database nowadays, such as Knack, Improv ado, etc. However, our team would go for MySQL, which technology giants use like Facebook, Twitter, Google, and so forth. One of the reasons that make MySQL popular is its compatibility with many critical computing infrastructures such as Linux, macOS, and Windows. Moreover, the programming language that MySQL uses is C/C++. In our team, Tri Dung is the one who experienced two years of coding C/C++ language in the U.S, which makes the use of MySQL more feasible and efficient in our project.</p>

    <div class="col-md-9 mt-sm-20 left-align-p">
    <p>Another thing that should be highlighted is that database is the most crucial part of our website since it contains all the information and data. Therefore, the database always needs to be protected and cannot be revealed publicly. One of the best ways to do that is creating a server, which is the only means to get access information from the database. Moreover, a server acts as a backend for communication between web users on the internet. To take advantage of JavaScript logics, Nodejs software is the most optimal choice. To be more specific, Nodejs provides a productive programming environment for both frontend and backend programmers to code. Moreover, Nodejs has a fast-processing speed, which can handle thousands of connections at the same time without errors due to the non-blocking feature. Also, if our project is supposed to expand in the future, using Nodejs is an easy option.</p>
    <p>As our project plan develops, the website usually acts to share information with people and acts as a blog that connects people, especially the elderly. Hence, our web required a tool as Socker.IO to connect between server and clients. Indeed, Socket.IO is a module in Nodejs developed in 2010. It was developed to use open connections to facilitate real-time communication, returning real value at that time. Besides, most programmers and organizations such as Microsoft Office, Yammer, GitHub, etc., means that Socket.IO has an enormous community. Therefore, it is more possible to find help from other programmers if our project has any mistakes than other tools.</p>
    <p>After discussing the text-to-speech feature in our project, our team decided not to create a text-to-voice tool. Instead, we will use FPT.AI as a text-to-speech tool that supports the Vietnamese language.</p>

    <div class="col-md-9">
    <p class="text-left">Finally, to minimize the cyber-attacks, our team also must focus on cyber-security. Overall, there are two ways to increase the cyber-security of our website. The first way that should be mentioned is to create solid logic in JavaScript to eliminate vulnerabilities and intrusions from hacker cybersecurity attacks. However, hackers now also have AI tools to scan vulnerabilities in the system, attack, and then intrude into the website system to steal private data. As a result, if the project gains vast profits, my team will use the second solution: AI for cyber-security. Nowadays, Darktrace is one of the best tools that “delivers unified and adaptive protection across diverse systems and distributed users. It detects both known and unknown threats as they emerge.”<a href="https://www.darktrace.com/en/products/enterprise">(Darktrace 2020)</a></p>

  <h3>Project's Testing</h3>
  <p>Since our project is making a website to share information for the elderly and acts as a blog, we plan to test the project step by step. To be more specific, we must build and test our standard website frame first. After that, our team would start putting the information on the website, decorating the background, and choosing the appropriate font size and color. To optimize the website's effect, we planned to ask some elderly in our families and neighbors to get about 50 to 100 feedback. Basing on their feedbacks, we will customize our website to make it more suitable for the elderly.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="appliance-top-border text-right">
    <div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-9">
    <p class="text-left">Furthermore, we could also ask the users who gave us the feedback mentioned above about their health status, health diseases, and so forth. By having some data and information from the target users, we could gather and share on our website helpful documents and information to help users raise awareness about their healthy life such as suitable daily activities for the elderly, diet for the elderly, etc. Following this, we would try to learn and build a database system for storing data as soon as possible. After testing the database system, our team probably must build a server connected to the database. If we successfully test the cases of the server and database, we probably could operate our website. Since we had not experienced Socket.IO and Cybersecurity, we must learn and ask for advice from other professional IT people such as our professors, our IT friends who know about the fields we were using for the website.</p>

  <h3>Group Processes & Communications</h3>
  <p>Due to the different timetable of every group member, it was challenging for us to make a face-to-face meeting to do the project together. First, we planned to meet every weekend and in-class IT tutorials. However, since we had to do the final project for other courses, meeting at the weekend seemed impossible. Hence, we only spent time working face-to-face for our project on Tuesday, which is the day we have IT tutorial class, and we also can stay after the class finishes to discuss the project's progress. Otherwise, each person would consider and take up the works appropriated with their ability and then work independently. If we struggled with the work, we could ask others by texting our Facebook or Messenger. Sometimes, it was not easy to contact others on social media since they were busy and could not check their phone notifications. Therefore, we agreed that everyone should give their phone numbers to others to call in essential cases. Sometimes, we also came to one of the team members' accommodation to easily communicate and exchange our works. To minimize the chance that some members could not check and respond to the group messages, we usually only communicated in the group chat messenger in the evening or at night since everyone often stayed at home to work at night.</p>
