<h6>Lead Developer</h6>
<h3>Binh Nguyen</h3>
<h4>S3883631, SCHOOL OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, RMIT UNIVERSITY</h4>
<p>Our first member of the team is Binh. He was born in Hanoi, and his full name is Nguyen Huy Binh. Binh has a relatively complicated educational background. To be more specific, he studied most of the time in Vietnam. However, he decided to study in the 12th grade in the US and graduated with a US high school diploma. Then he continued studying computer science in college in Illinois, USA. When the COVID-19 swing by, he had to discontinue his USA education and move back to Vietnam. He decided to continue to study at RMIT in Ho Chi Minh City when he came back. He is currently studying Information Technology; his student ID is s3883631. His IT interest is mainly inspired by his Computer Science teacher when he studied in the US. Besides, he also believes that his meticulousness and concentration suit utterly Information Technology. Binh is a big fan of motorbikes and traveling. One of his biggest dreams is to travel through every province in Vietnam with his motorbike.</p>

  <h3>Dung Nguyen</h3>
  <h4>S3883630, SCHOOL OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, RMIT UNIVERSITY</h4>
  <p>The next member of our team is Nguyen Tri Dung. His student ID number is s3883630, and his hometown is also Hanoi, like Binh. He is the oldest member of our team: he is 21 years old whereas the rest is 20. He used to study at the National Economics University in Hanoi for one year. However, after he realized that he did not fit in for Economic, Dung switched to Computer Science major and studied aboard in the US. His graduation in the US was supposed to be in 2023. Unfortunately, like Binh, due to the pandemic of COVID-19, he came back to Vietnam and could not return to the US. Then, he chose RMIT to study a Bachelor of Information Technology and planned to study Ph.D. in Canada or the US. Dung is interested in how AI work and how to develop software. His IT interest came when he was a child. Unlike other children who usually like toys and games, Dung often read or watched something about science, especially sci-fi movies. Furthermore, on his first day of a Computer Science class, there was an event that motived him to immerse himself in learning Computer Science. His professor showed him that he could use the computer as usual, but only with a keyboard and without the mouse, making Dung impressive. Dung knows many languages, even though just at the primary level, but he could communicate with his international friends when he was still studying in the US. His most significant hobby is online games such as League of Legends and PUBG, by which Dung could communicate with other people from all over the world. He is also interested in musical instruments, especially guitar and piano.</p>

  <h3>Dat Dinh</h3>
  <h4>S3819827, SCHOOL OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY, RMIT UNIVERSITY</h4>
  <p>Our last member is Dat. His full name is Dinh Ba Dat. Unlike the rest of the team, Dat's educational background is entirely in Vietnam. He was interested in the computer because he considers it to make our lives more comfortable. When 16, he likes to research technology-related aspects, such as an app, mobile device, and computer. A famous character inspired him in his favorite movie, which is Iron Man. He knows that Iron Man is just a fictional character, but that impacts Dat a lot in his interest in IT, which he can do something like Iron Man and help people with technologies. He admits himself as an introverted person. His hobby is just staying at home and playing video games. He also has a lovely dog, which is his most loyal friend in his life. Swimming is also Dat's favorite sport.</p>
