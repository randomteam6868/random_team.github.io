  <h3>How we begin</h3>
  <p>Our team name is Random, so all members did not know each other until the teacher recommends us to be a team. We have difficult communication in our first time, but now we are a friend, so it has solved that problem. Our team has four members, but we have three different ideas: AR, GPS, and AI. AR is beneficial in our life such as military training, flight training, and AR glasses, but it requires much knowledge related to hardware that we do not know. GPS can help tourist finds many places to eat or stay, but in Vietnam, we can easily find a place without seeing a map by asking people on the road. Therefore, we come up with our last idea, which is AI. Binh, who is a member of our team, has found this project. In our opinion, his idea can be more comfortable and more practical than others.</p>

    <h3 class="mb-30 title_color">What does this project do?</h3>
    <div class="row">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/meaning.png" alt="">
    <p>Elders who are over 65 years old take 8% of the world population in 2020, and it can be 16% in 2025(1). Lead to, the amount of health need of elders is increasing. However, the hospital may not receive all the elders, and it also cost the elders a lot. Therefore, we will use AI to make a web-app for the elderly, improving the elders' quality of life. This website can do many things based on its function, such as measuring health status, danger warnings, helping people with hearing loss, assisting, connecting to other people, and conversation. This website can show information about health status, danger warning when the elders have an emergency, assist for deaf and blind, and make a community for elders to reduce the loneliness.</p>
    <div class="col-md-4">
    <div class="single-defination">
    <h4 class="mb-20">Measure health status</h4>
    <p>It can measure heart rate, blood pressure, and vision using the hardware and software available on their device or base on the data user provide to our website through AI chatbot. This function also takes note of every information related to the elders' health and store in cloud computing to follow the elders' health day by day. If they need an advisory for their health, our AI software can analyze their health status to give them an excellent advisory to their health. Thus, the senior does not have to go to the hospital and check their health every day. There is a storing blood group function we want to do so on, which can be used in an emergency. For instance, when the elders have emergency surgery, the doctor can access our cloud computing to know which group of blood they are. It can reduce the time to check their blood group and take actions immediately in emergency situations.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
    <div class="single-defination">
    <h4 class="mb-20">Danger warn</h4>
    <p>This function is one of the most important features of our website because it can save the elders' lives. In old age, there is some diseases that we cannot check, and it can appear at any time that can kill the elders live such as stroke and heart attack. So, we have decided to make a function that may save their lives by sending an emergency message to their relative or hospital. For example, suppose an elderly have a heart attack. In that case, our AI will measure the senior response in the chatbot to know elder issue and sending an emergency message to the hospital and relative to they can send an ambulance. We also want to add a function that can make noise to attract people to come to help.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
    <div class="single-defination">
    <h4 class="mb-20">Help blind and deaf senior</h4>
    <p>This function is useful to blind and deaf people. For deaf people, there is a function that can convert the voice into text using virtual assistants, so they can enjoy a movie or a news video. For blind people, the senior can control the website by using their voice command. So, the chatbot can do some action on the website like converting the news from text to voice.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
      <div class="single-defination">
      <h4 class="mb-20">Making community for elders</h4>
      <p>This function propose is to communicate with other people. In old age, many elders feel lonely because they do not have someone to talk to or make friends with, so we decide to make a social network to gather elders in different places to talk. This social network will be like Facebook, but it is only available for elders to make friends or share their status in that network. It can make them happier in their lives because the elders' lifestyle is boring. In this community, they can share useful information.</p>
      </div>

  <div class="section-top-border">
    <h3 class="mb-30 title_color">Progress</h3>
    <div class="row">
    <img class="img-fluid" src="img/progress.png" alt="">
    <p>We have decided to use two technique in this project which is AI and cloud computing. We have a meeting with other members, but it hard to work as a group on this project because we just met each other three times. Firstly, we have a challenge to communicate because we have an exam in other subjects, so we do not spend much time on this project, so we start doing this project late. Binh is a crucial member of this project because he has outlined this project by himself in assignment 2. We will start by making a prototype website that Binh is doing right now.  Because we have three weeks to finish this project, we decide to make an experiment version for this project.</p>
    <div class="col-md-4">
    <div class="single-defination">
    <h4 class="mb-20">Difficult and changing plan</h4>
    <p>We plan to complete all the function we mention above, but it does not work like our expectation. Some function requires tremendous knowledge of AI and hardware to develop it. The virtual assistant run by AI cannot be developed yet because it requires a lot of new knowledge and technical about AI. Therefore, we decide to develop these functions in future because it takes too much time and knowledge.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
    <div class="single-defination">
    <h4 class="mb-20">What we have done so far</h4>
    <p>We have developed two functions: giving information for the elders and making a blogging website for the elders. The information will include news, health advices for senior. Blogging is for senior to sharing their story or lifeâ€™s trick for other senior, then it will create a form for the elder community. But these two functions are experiment version, so it still needs to be upgraded more in the future.</p>
    </div>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
    <div class="single-defination">
    <h4 class="mb-20">Planning</h4>
    <p>The next function we want to develop is danger warn because it is an essential function for the elders. Since we currently do not have enough knowledge and experience to make this function, we decide to learn and complete it in the future. Furthermore, Binh planned to follow an AI career in the future. Based on usersâ€™ tones when they speak to our AI chatbot, it will detect whether their health is ok or not.</p>
